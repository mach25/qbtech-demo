# Specifications:

Your application should be implemented as a web service designed to be used by multiple clients. It should expose a few endpoints to allow the following operations:

* Create a new counter with a name;
* Increment counter by 1;
* Get the current value of a given counter by name;
* Get a list of all counters and their current values;
* Delete counter by name
* Delete all counters

## Notes:

* This API should be considered using by any client (WEB|Android|iOS)
* No need to hold a state between app's launches
